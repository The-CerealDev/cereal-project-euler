``` python 

    fib = [1,2]
    nextNo = 0
    evenSum = 2 
    highest = 4*(10**6)
    while nextNo < highest:
        nextNo = fib[-1] + fib[-2]
        if nextNo % 2 == 0 and nextNo < highest:
            evenSum += nextNo
            
        fib.append(nextNo)

    print(evenSum)

```
solution in python emplying a list and a while loop using the negative index to add the 2 elements at the end of the list of fibonacci numbers starting from [1,2]
